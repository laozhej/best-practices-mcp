# Live BadgeApp transfer checks in Chrome

These screenshots were captured during the **M3 live application QA checkpoint**, after document operations and artifact generation were implemented and before M4 added persistent drafts. The November 9, 2026 session exercised PolicyChecks (project 14356), silver level, in authenticated Chrome using MCP-generated proposals and a form-fill script.

The checks demonstrated edit-form behavior only. No Save or Submit action was taken. Temporary `Unmet` statuses and QA text were test inputs, not assessments of the project. The URLs and script below document the exercised inputs; current site data may produce different form results if they are replayed.

## Cases and associated artifacts

| Case | What the screenshots demonstrate | Screenshot | Associated URL or script |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Standalone justification without override | Existing explanation retained; status remained Met | [Retained explanation](01-no-override-retrospective.png) | Exact URL not retained. Proposal supplied `contribution_requirements_justification` without an override. |
| 2. Exact justification override | Proposed explanation displayed; status retained; automation marker present | [Overridden explanation](02-exact-override-retrospective.png) | Exact URL not retained. Proposal supplied `contribution_requirements_justification` and explicitly overrode that field. |
| 3. Divergent unforced status | Existing status and explanation retained despite an explicit justification override; divergent proposal notice displayed | [Blocked paired explanation](03-blocked-justification-retrospective.png) | Exact URL not retained. Proposal supplied `contribution_requirements_status=Unmet` and a justification, overriding only the justification. |
| 4. Unchanged forced status | Met remained selected; changed explanation retained its inherited override after the unchanged status was omitted from the URL | [Inherited override](04-inherited-override.png) | Exact URL not retained. The requested override named `contribution_requirements_status`; the effective emitted override named `contribution_requirements_justification`. |
| 5. Changed forced status | Both supplied controls replaced; expanded notice showed previous values | [Status and explanation replaced](05-changed-status-inherited-override.png) | [Exact proposal URL](05-proposal-url.txt) |
| 6. URL whitespace and Unicode | Form trimmed outer ASCII spaces while preserving internal text and Unicode | [URL text](06-whitespace-unicode.png) | [Exact proposal URL](06-proposal-url.txt), retaining the encoded leading/trailing spaces |
| 7. Script assignment | Exact raw text, including two leading and trailing spaces, preserved; console reported `filled` | [Selected text](07-script-whitespace-selection.png), [console result](07-script-console-second-execution.jpg) | [Exact generated script](07-fill.js) |
| 8. Multi-criterion preview | All 24 inspected controls across 12 criteria matched the expected fill, override, retention, blocking and unchanged cases | [Criterion screenshots below](#multi-criterion-preview) | [Exact proposal URL](08-proposal-url.txt) |
| 9. Discard and restore | Original form values restored after previews were discarded; no QA markers visible in the inspected form | [Restoration screenshots below](#baseline-restoration) | [Plain silver edit page](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/14356/silver/edit#all), without proposal parameters |

The first three images are retrospective captures from existing tabs. In case 7, the selected-text image records the first form observation; the console image records a second execution of the same script. The reopened-console image without a result is excluded. The notice in case 3 shows the supplied proposal, not an independent BadgeApp assessment.

### Multi-criterion preview

The bulk preview supplied 21 answer fields; its URL encoded 14 and omitted seven unchanged fields. Each screenshot is associated with the same [bulk proposal URL](08-proposal-url.txt).

### Baseline restoration

The restored form matched twelve baseline statuses and eight displayed justifications. Four preview-filled justifications were no longer displayed, so their hidden values were not asserted from browser inspection. A subsequent public MCP read matched the earlier silver baseline; this separate observation does not establish save-time behavior.

## Evidence treatment and limits

The browser images remove exactly the top 175 pixels containing browser chrome; the console image is uncropped. Retained pixels were verified unchanged and embedded metadata was removed. The originals remain in the private development archive. These images and associated artifacts are repository-only documentation, excluded from wheel and source distributions.

Clicking generated links in the Codex UI successfully opened the previews, demonstrating a working path beyond a host opening the browser directly. The separately reported Claude Code → TextEdit → browser copy-paste failure was not reproduced or diagnosed; equivalence with that path is not assumed.
