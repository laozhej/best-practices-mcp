# Design decisions

This maintained document explains the server's design boundaries. Initial implementation plans and milestone records are historical evidence of how the design was developed; they do not override the current contracts.

## Prepare changes; leave the final save to the human

Here, leaving the save to the human means leaving the decision and its execution outside this MCP, not requiring the user to click a button personally. A user may authorize a host agent to operate the browser and click Save on their behalf. That delegation belongs to the user and host; it is neither implemented nor prohibited by this server.

The MCP deliberately provides no tool that directly saves changes to a BadgeApp application through an authenticated API request. This is a scope and interaction-design decision, not an assertion that upstream lacks an API for changing project data.

Upstream documents REST writes, but its [automation proposals documentation](https://github.com/ossf/best-practices-badge/blob/868e1677339a3fdb48851b0c2ae8862c553115eb/docs/automation-proposals.md) explicitly no longer encourages that route for changes: authentication is an additional responsibility, and REST writes do not let the user review changes in the BadgeApp UI. The proposal interface instead gives the authorized human an opportunity to review, modify, approve, or discard proposed answers before saving. The same document describes existing-project REST changes as `PUT`; the exclusion here applies to authenticated remote writes regardless of HTTP method.

The server therefore prepares portable draft documents, proposal URLs, and form-fill scripts. Updating a stored draft changes a local file only. Opening a proposal URL or executing a generated script prepares the edit form; neither artifact submits the form. The human reviews the resulting application in BadgeApp and decides whether to save it. Authentication, browser interaction, and presentation of the handoff belong to the host and user, not to the MCP server.

A direct API save could be preceded by a host-managed approval step, so it is not inherently incompatible with human approval. Nevertheless, adding that tool would move the approval boundary into each host and allow the server to perform the final remote mutation. Keeping the final save in BadgeApp better supports upstream's human-review principle while keeping this server's tool surface bounded. Direct saving is not an unimplemented commitment or an upcoming milestone; introducing it would require a separately approved scope and design change.

The MCP does not enforce a host's entire approval workflow or certify that a human has reviewed an artifact. Its narrower guarantee is that its tools do not save BadgeApp applications. Artifact generation and advisory validation also do not predict the final persisted values or reproduce BadgeApp's Save/Submit processing. Those outcomes remain the site's responsibility.

## Follow documented procedures, not internal save behavior

The server is designed to respect upstream's documented automation procedures. Its compatibility contract draws on the pinned automation documentation, criteria YAML and English locale, and explicitly agreed MCP rules. It implements bounded artifact preparation and documented edit-form transfer behavior; it does not simulate submission or infer final acceptance, saved values, importer behavior, or automated assessments from BadgeApp's internal Ruby implementation.

Upstream Ruby sources were consulted during development to investigate ambiguities, understand behavior, and establish provenance. That investigation is legitimate supporting evidence, but it does not make every observed implementation detail a requirement or expand the server's contract. Where documentation is ambiguous or conflicts with observed internals, the compatibility decision must be made explicit and reviewed rather than silently adopting the internal behavior.

Retained Ruby source excerpts, fixture-generation scripts, and historical generated fixtures support optional manual maintainer investigation. `make oracle-check` explicitly runs selected pinned Ruby methods and supplementary comparisons under `tests/optional/`; `ruby tests/fixtures/upstream/generate_oracle.rb` separately regenerates the historical catalog fixture for deliberate review. These diagnostics are not required tests, CI acceptance gates, or publication gates, and they do not establish Save/Submit outcomes. A discrepancy is a reason to investigate the documented contract, not an instruction to change the server to match internal Ruby behavior.

Required conformance tests run without Ruby. The source distribution retains the diagnostic development materials, while the installed wheel and server runtime do not depend on Ruby. See the maintained [testing policy](testing-policy.md) for the required checks and optional commands.
